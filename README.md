# LSTM Oil Price Prediction Project

This repository contains all the necessary files and Jupyter notebooks for predicting OPEC oil prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Below is a brief description of each file included in this project.

## Files Overview

### 1. **Oil.csv**
   - **Description:** This is the primary dataset used for training and testing the LSTM model. It contains historical OPEC oil prices with dates.

### 2. **PredictedOnOct.ipynb**
   - **Description:** A Jupyter notebook that predicts OPEC oil prices on a future date (specifically 1st October 2025). The notebook includes all the steps from loading the data to plotting the predicted results.

### 3. **README.md**
   - **Description:** The file you are currently reading. It provides an overview of all the files in the repository and their purposes.

### 4. **TanhAndSigmoid.ipynb**
   - **Description:** This notebook provides a detailed comparison of the Sigmoid and Tanh activation functions. It includes plots of both functions to visually demonstrate their differences and mathematical equations.

### 5. **TheAppendix.ipynb**
   - **Description:** This notebook contains additional results and analyses that support the main project. It might include different configurations of the LSTM model, exploration of different hyperparameters, or further visualization of the results.

### 6. **TheProject.ipynb**
   - **Description:** The main Jupyter notebook for the project. This notebook walks through the entire process of developing the LSTM model for predicting OPEC oil prices. It includes data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and final predictions.

### 7. **VaildData.csv**
   - **Description:** A validation dataset used to test the model's performance on unseen data. The dataset is likely used in `TheProject.ipynb` to validate the robustness and generalization ability of the LSTM model.

## Getting Started
