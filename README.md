# LSTM Oil Price Prediction Project

This repository contains all the necessary files and Jupyter notebooks for predicting OPEC oil prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Below is a brief description of each file included in this project.

## Files Overview

### 1. **TheProject.ipynb**
   - **Description:** The main Jupyter notebook for the project. This notebook walks through the entire process of developing the LSTM model for predicting OPEC oil prices. It includes data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and final predictions.
### 2. **PredictedOnOct.ipynb**
   - **Description:** A Jupyter notebook that predicts OPEC oil prices on a future date (specifically 1st October 2025). 
### 3. **Oil.csv**
   - **Description:** This is the primary dataset used for training and testing the LSTM model. It contains historical OPEC oil prices with dates.

### 4. **VaildData.csv**
   - **Description:** A validation dataset used to test the model's performance on unseen data. 


### 4. **TanhAndSigmoid.ipynb**
   - **Description:**  It includes plots of Sigmoid and Tanh activation functions to visually demonstrate their differences and mathematical equations.

### 5. **TheAppendix.ipynb**
   - **Description:** This notebook contains additional plots and analyses that support the main project.
